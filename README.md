## 🪖 Behind the Code
This project was written during my free time in military service. In the quiet hours, surrounded by duty and discipline, I turned to code as both escape and challenge. Sudoku was the perfect metaphor — a grid of chaos slowly tamed by logic and patience.

I hope this little game brings you the same sense of focus and calm it gave me.
